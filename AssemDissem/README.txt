Assemble.cpp is the Assembler for this project, and it requires user input. The file will have to be built 
and compiled. Disassembler.cpp also needs to be built and compiled. The warnings on the compiling can be 
ignored.

The terminal will ask for an input after the files are made and will ask the user to enter a .hack file in the 
Disassembler and create a .asm file and an .asm file in the Assembler and create a .hack file.
